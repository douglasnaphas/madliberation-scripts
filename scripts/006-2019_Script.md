# Mad Liberation: Waiting for Haggadot
Let’s get a few things out of the way, just to level-set. Let’s all get on the same screen.


First of all, this is not your bubbe’s Haggadah. This is also not your bubbe’s {{ item an old person has // // // Chrysler Town and Country }}. Some things may be shocking. Others will be frustrating. Still more will be {{ adjective // // This is __ // uplifting }}.


Literally no one in the world is experiencing the very same seder that we are. Nor will anyone again. This gathering, tonight, is like {{ something that only happens once // // // the Cretaceous–Paleogene_extinction_event }}. Except we’ll actually enjoy it.
# {{ Page }}
By the end of this celebration, you will be like a free Jew, and you know how Jews love free things (but not in an offensive way). I myself love {{ something free // // I got __ // stolen train rides }}.


Imagine yourself baked into crisp matzah. Split into two pieces. Hidden. Found. Dipped, in saltwater. Washed, in preparation for the seder. Washed again, in preparation for the meal. Washed after the meal.


Eaten, like a meal. Washed down, with four glasses of wine. Thrown up, after four more. Thrown out of Egypt. Called back. Finally freed.


Anyway, let’s go over the agenda. We are going, in order, to:


קַדֵּשׁ Bless that wine | kadeish |
וּרְחַץ Wash those hands | urchatz |
כַּרְפַּס Dip those greens | karpas |
יַחַץ Break the matzah | yachatz |
מַגִּידTell that story | magid |
רָחְצָה Re-wash those hands | rachtza |
מוֹצִיא מַצָּה Bless that food | motzi matzah |
מוֹצִיא מַצָּה Re-bless that food | motzi matzah |
מָרוֹר Sweeten those herbs | maror |
כּוֹרֵךְ Make that sandwich | koreich |
שֻׁלְחָן עוֹרֵךְ Eat that meal | shulchan oreich |
צָפוּן Find that afikoman | tzafoon |
בָּרֵךְ Invite that Prophet | bareich |
הַלֵּל Praise that God | hallel |
נִרְצָה Imagine that future | nirtzah |
מילצוש {{ Positive transitive verb // // I am going to __ that thing // Buy }} that {{ positive thing // // //  }} |.{{ a made-up Hebrew word // hirpapv // __ // basusin }} |


Let’s Jew this.
# {{ Page }}
Kiddush will be kiddush | kadeish
It is tradition, indeed, it is a mitzvah, to conduct pieces of our seder in the ancient language of {{ a made-up language // Frianche // I speak __ // Getonyanese}}, which was in fact spoken by the Children of Israel when they were slaves in Egypt. For those not familiar, it sounds like this:
    {{ One phlegmy syllable (not a real word) // haechgh // __ // blech}} {{ two phlegmy syllables (not a real word) // bi-bachgh // __ // vi-vlecht}} {{ One phlegmy syllable (not a real word) // haechgh // __ // vlicht}} {{ three phlegmy syllables (not a real word) // ghamagheef // __ // gamaschische}} {{ One syllable (not a real word) // ur // __ // mi}} {{ One phlegmy syllable (not a real word) // haechgh // __ // mecht}} {{ three phlegmy syllables (not a real word) // ghamagheef // __ // vaganeeghth}}


As a secondary language, many Jews also spoke Hebrew. Much like today.


Hebrew, for its part, sounds more like this:


    בָּרוּךְ אַתָּה יְיָ, אֱלֹהֵינוּ מֶלֶךְ הָעוֹלָם, בּוֹרֵא פְּרִי הַגָּפֶן:
    Baruch Atah Adonai, Eloheinu Melech ha-olam, borei p’ree hagafen.


    בָּרוּךְ אַתָּה יְיָ, אֱלֹהֵינוּ מֶלֶךְ הָעוֹלָם,
 שֶׁהֶחֱיָנוּ וְקִיְּמָנוּ וְהִגִּיעָנוּ לַזְּמַן הַזֶּה:    
    Baruch Atah Adonai, Eloheinu Melech ha-olam,
    she-hechiyanu v’key’manu v’higiyanu lazman hazeh.


Thank you.


The prayer we just prayed thanks God for {{ a transitive culinary verb // grating // The cook is __ // squeezing }} the sacred and holy {{ fruits // melons // a bowl of __ // quinces }} She blessed ups with to make sweet wine. This wine symbolizes how sweet it is to be free from slavery, and how much more likely we are as free persons to {{ thing you enjoy doing by yourself // walk around naked // I like to __ // burp into my dog’s mouth}}. 


Be free, be sweet, be thirsty, and fill the cup of the person to your {{ left or right // left // You are to my __ // left }}.
# {{ Page }}
## Shake that ass, but wash yourself | urchatz


Your hands have certainly gotten dirty sitting here all this time, especially if you’ve been {{ doing something gross //   // I was __ // slinging mud }}. So we have to cleanse them. Now. Right now. Please, for everyone’s sake.


Even washing our hands is something to be grateful for--slaves in Egypt could only wash themselves every {{ integer greater than 1 // 27 // __ > 1 // 500 }}  days.


However, because we are free, we are going to exclaim loudly, together, the sacred phrase of our ancient rabbis. Here is how we shall proceed.


1. I will exclaim something.
2. You will listen to it.
3. {{ Someone here tonight // // __ is here tonight // I }} will {{ take an inappropriate action // .burp // He will __ // kvetch }}
4. You will repeat the sacred phrase.
5. I will pantomime the action described by the sacred phrase, which is as yet unknown to me.
6. You will all follow in my pantomime.


And now, without further ado, the sacred, cleansing phrase:


“{{ something you get scolded to do // do the dishes //  You have to __! // wash between your toes }}!”


We’re all clean! We can begin to commence thinking about maybe starting to ponder having dinner. 
# {{ Page }}
Gratitude Interlude
Let’s take a pause from this busy schedule to reflect on what is meaningful in our lives. We are going to go around the room and share in 30 seconds or less. I’ll go first. Then we’ll go {{ clockwise or counterclockwise // clockwise // We will go __ // counterclockwise }}.


And that was it. That was my turn.
# {{ Page }}
## When I dip, you dip, we dip a green vegetable in saltwater | karpas


And we begin with the Hebrew again:




    בָּרוּךְ אַתָּה יְיָ, אֱלֹהֵינוּ מֶלֶךְ הָעוֹלָם, בּוֹרֵא פְּרִי הָאֲדָמָה:
    Baruch Atah Adonai, Eloheinu Melech ha-olam, borei p’ree ha-adama.
    We praise God, Ruler of Everything, who creates the fruits of the earth.


For the unknowing, be it now known that the great Muppet {{ crazy name// Laserface // This is  __ // Barko }} the {{ animal // giraffe // This is a(n)  __ // goat }} said, “It’s not easy eating greens,” especially when they’re dipped in saltwater. Yet we must. Why?


Be it known also, that according to scripture, Rabbi {{ a capitalized word, any capitalized word //  Bucket  // “__” is definitely a word // Dragon }} Bergenstein was sitting in a meadow one spring morning and pronounced:


[To the tune of “Tears on My Pillow” from Grease. If you don’t know it, make it up.]


    Tears on my parsley
    {{ negative emotion // sadness// __ // consternation }}, in my
    {{ organ // heart // __ // spleen }},
    Felt by Jews
    Oo - oo - ooo - oooo - ooooooo


And that is why we dip our green vegetable in saltwater:  to enhance the flavor of our suffering.
# {{ Page }}
## It's time for a matzah break! | yachatz


Look at all this sumptuous matzah before us. Everyone, seriously look. Imagine yourself eating it. Seriously, everyone: imagine. That’s all you get to do, because we’re not eating now. 


We’re breaking. 


Someone locate the piles of matzah on the table. They could be resting under a napkin, inside your grandma’s lacquered matzah box, or hiding in {{ person or people in this room and something that belongs to them // Josh’s Lunchbox  // this is  __ // Michael’s mouth }}. When the moment comes, I will assign someone to take the middle matzah from this pile and to render it in two. The larger half (how can one half be larger? This might be the 5th question!) shall be passed to me. I will {{ adverb // hungrily //  do it  __ // wretchedly}} hide this bounty as the afikomen, which literally translates to: gift of the {{ adjective // lovely //  a(n)  __ thing // flimsy }}  {{ thing // grocery bag //  this is a(n)  __ // handjob}}.
After dinner, all you guests will have to hunt for this afikomen  and win a prize. What could it be? A trip to {{ very descriptive place // the most fly-ridden dump in Kansas  // going to __ // the gates of Hell }}?  A hot and heavy, yet romantic evening with {{ a person at this Seder // Josh  // __ is at this Seder  // Vinny }}? An annuity payment of {{ small number that is not one // two // __  // three }}  shekels in your bank account over the next {{ number greater than ten // three-hundred and four // __  // seventy }} {{ units of time // years // __  // minutes }}? You get to pick! 


Remember the greatest rabbinical maxim: “a good thing will come to ye who search for it”. 


At last, our moment has come. There is no blessing. There is no curse. There is just the snapping of the unleavened bread...Go!




# {{ Page }}
Pre-magid
Have you ever wondered why you are not a slave today? Have you ever wondered why, instead of {{ transitive verb // punishing   // you are __ it // licking }} your Master’s {{ thing // bagel  // the __  // horseshoes}} every day, you get to do whatever you please, as long as you’re working?


The reason for your freedom lies is this holy tale. It is a hymn of {{ characteristic or emotion // courage  // a person of great __  // dignity}} and {{ characteristic or emotion // courage  // a person of great __   // nudity }}, of how the hero of the Hebrews risked everything to free everyone, with nothing but his mighty staff and a little help from an omnipotent friend. And it begins shortly. 


But before we begin anything, we must always think of the children, for we were children once and were thought over...


...and speaking of kids...they say the darndest things, am I right? Especially when they are forced to say things in Hebrew. Last year, at Passover, some kid asked, {{ a dumb question // Is the moon made of cheese? //  __ ? // What happens if I fall into my bellybutton? }} Can you believe it? Good thing we don’t have any kids here, tonight. 


# {{ Page: To Youngest }}
Ahem.
# {{ Page: From Youngest }}
Didn’t see you there! You are so small! Well, since you’re here, we might as well put you to work. Now, almost all of us know the entire history of the {{ holiday or great day //passover // we celebrate  __ // St Patrick’s Day }} but I’m sure this {{ immature insult you’d use to insult a kid// bubble butt //you are a ____//fish vomit stick}} has some questions about it. 


Let us hear from that who is the FURTHEST in age from Israel. 
# {{ Page: To Youngest }}
Thank you family. First off let me say that I am not uneducated. In fact, I was the one who first theorized the {{a name of a made up theory// the scientific month//Edison thought of the___ theory//Flabby Billy Theory}} theory. 


But I do have some questions And when I have questions, I like to sing them in perfect Hebrew.  




מַה נִּשְׁתַּנָּה הַלַּֽיְלָה הַזֶּה מִכָּל הַלֵּילוֹת?
Ma nishtana halaila hazeh mikol haleilot?


שֶׁבְּכָל הַלֵּילוֹת אָֽנוּ אוֹכְלִין חָמֵץ וּמַצָּה. הַלַּֽיְלָה הַזֶּה כֻּלּוֹ מַצָּה:
Shebichol haleilot anu ochlin chameitz u-matzah. Halaila
hazeh kulo matzah.


שֶׁבְּכָל הַלֵּילוֹת אָֽנוּ אוֹכְלִין שְׁאָר יְרָקוֹת הַלַּֽיְלָה הַזֶּה מָרוֹר:
Shebichol haleilot anu ochlin shi’ar yirakot. Halaila hazeh
Maror.


בְּכָל הַלֵּילוֹת אֵין אָֽנוּ מַטְבִּילִין אֲפִילוּ פַּֽעַם אֶחָת.
 הַלַּֽיְלָה הַזֶּה שְׁתֵּי פְעָמִים:
Shebichol haleilot ain anu matbilin afilu pa-am echat. Halaila hazeh shtei pa-amim.


שֶׁבְּכָל הַלֵּילוֹת אָֽנוּ אוֹכְלִין בֵּין יוֹשְׁבִין וּבֵין מְסֻבִּין.
 הַלַּֽיְלָה הַזֶּה כֻּלָּֽנוּ מְסֻבִּין:
Shebichol haleilot anu ochlin bein yoshvin uvein m’subin.
Halaila hazeh kulanu m’subin.


I know you’re all as old as  {{something old // A dinosaur // My grandpa is as old as ____ // Stonehenge}}and might not speak Hebrew, so I’ll translate that for you.


I said, why is this night different from all other nights? I mean, I usually do the exact same thing every night, specifically, I {{ weird ritual you might do // brush my teeth with a pencil // Every night, I ____// gargle coffee to the tune of “Row, Row, Row Your Boat”}}, every night, but tonight, I’m here with you. Why?
# {{ Page: From Youngest }}
Different how? Like apples and {{ plural noun // killer whales // Those are ____! // boogers}}? Can you be more specific? 


# {{ Page: To Youngest }}
Well, for instance, on all other nights I eat leavened bread and {{type of food//apple pie//I love to eat ____!//flan}}, but tonight I’m only eating matzah. And like nine other courses. Why?


# {{ Page: From Youngest }}
Have you ever tried to build pyramids while eating three square meals a day? I don’t think so! Our slave ancestors ate matzah because they had no time to {{ action that doesn’t take a long time // sneeze // Some people can ____ in five seconds. // put on socks }}, let alone wait for yeast to rise. What’s your next question, {{ term of endearment // sweet potato // I call my husband ____. // sugar lumpkin }}?
# {{ Page: To Youngest }}
On every other night I eat tons of vegetables. TONS. Here are a few of the vegetables I eat daily: {{ type of vegetable//broccoli // My mom served me ____!// green beans }}, {{ type of vegetable//broccoli//My mom served me ____! // peas }}, {{ type of obscure vegetable // parsnip // My mom served me ____!// cabbage }}.But tonight I’m only eating bitter herbs! Why?
# {{ Page: From Youngest }}
Well, you see little young one, once we were slaves, and being a slave is very {{ word for disgusting // putrid // That old milk smells ___! // horrible }}, just like bitter herbs. Not like vegetables though...which are delightful.  


# {{ Page: To Youngest }}
Speaking of vegetables, why on this night do I dip my vegetables not just once but  {{ large number// 349 // He counted up to  ____!// 3958}} times. That’s so many times! 
# {{ Page: From Youngest }}
It’s just twice. But yes. On this night we dip twice because our ancestors were slaves, and that’s sad. So we dip in salt water, which represents their tears. Also because dipping is luxurious like {{luxurious activity // being fed grapes // When I want to feel fancy, I spend my days  ____. // bathing in gold coins}}, so there is that. 


# {{ Page: To Youngest }}
Ok last question. I promise. On all other nights I don’t recline. I sit up as straight as a {{stiff object // board // stiff as a ___ || wall}}. Why on this night do I get to recline on a {{soft object // pillow // soft as a ___ || fluffy bed}}?


# {{ Page: From Youngest }}




It’s because we’re FREE. You see we can do anything we want now. I can go into a deli and {{ Activity you’d do if there were no laws // rob a bank // If you ___, you will go to jail. // moon a diner waiter }} now. And so can you! And that’s the underlying message here.


Anyway, thank you, youngest person here, for your astute questions. You may go to bed.
# {{ Page }}
## Pre-Magid 2: the Four Sons
Perhaps you have heard of the Four Sons. Perhaps you think you know a thing or two about them. Perhaps you learned their story in {{ a place where you can learn things // the library // I learned that in __  // my neighbor’s basement }}.


Everything you know is wrong. About everything.


But I can only teach you about the sons. 


The first piece of groundbreaking information I can share about the sons is that there are four of them. Which I guess you already knew back when you were misinformed about the sons, so that one thing was true.


Other than that, {{ something you say when you don’t know what to say // um….err... // __ .... // Uhhhhh……...ummmmmm….. }} ...


# {{ Page }}
## The Wise Son 
Excuse me, but I am the wisest of sons. And sons are the wisest of children. So please allow me to mansplain all about the Four Sons.


And by, “Please allow me to,” I mean, “I am going to, no matter what you want.”


Jews learn from questions. It’s what makes us unique.


The purpose of the Four Sons is to ask the questions that will inform all persons here who are less knowledgeable than me. Which is all of you.


My question is the greatest. It is the question after which all questions are modeled.


{{ Something you’d be embarrassed to ask // What is water? // // Is it bad if my poop is yellow? }}
# {{ Page }}
## The Wise Answer
I think what you’re trying to say is, “What are the testimonials, statutes, and laws God has commanded us?”


Well, the prime testimonial is that we were slaves in Egypt and that means you should follow all the laws of Passover, including skipping dessert after dinner. It’s true. There’s no law on the amount of Matzah you can have, though. Here is a synopsis of all of God’s highly relevant Biblical commands:


Chukim: These are known as the Inexplicable Laws like “don’t mix wool with linen” and
 {{ A weird piece of advice // Don’t put BBQ sauce in your pants // __ // Always sit on the butter before you eat it }} )
Edot: These are the Explicable-But-Not-Intuitive Laws like celebrating Shabbat, Festivals, and Rites of Passage, like  {{ something a kid learns to do growing up // riding a bicycle // __ is something I remember // the first time eating solid food }} 
Mishpatim: These are the Intuitive Laws like don’t get caught stealing or  {{ something you’d probably get in trouble for if you were caught by your parents // watching too much TV // I got grounded for__ // punching your brother in his private parts}} 


Now, let me keep explaining...
# {{ Page }}
## The Wicked Son
Shut up! Stop talking. Where you do get off thinking you know everything?


Let me tell you what I get off on. I’m the Wicked Son and I get off on tangents.


What kind of tangents? Is that your question? All kinds of tangents. Mathematical tangents. Tan gents tanning at the beach. {{ A highly, highly, strange concept // gorillas doing Shakespeare on the Moon // // Dogs giving birth to cows }}. Anything unrelated to whatever’s happening.


Particularly whatever’s happening here, tonight. I don’t know what any of this is or how I got here, but I hate it.


And what’s up with these so called “commands?”  Who are you, {{ someone who gives commands // the commander // // Mom }}? If the commands are soooooo righteous, why am I forced to sit here and eat gefilte fish or wear this tight yarmulke?  And, like why do i have to {{ A complaint in present tense // go to school today // He was annoyed because he had to ____ // take my grandmother to church}} tonight?  What does all this mean to YOU?! 
# {{ Page }}
## The Wicked Answer
It means what God SAYS it means!


Wicked Son, I blunt your teeth. I wish we never invited you, you are the worst of the children. You are worse than {{ A horrible person from history // Ghangis Khan // __ was a terrible person // Haman}}. But I’m still happy you’re here, in the broadest sense.


So I guess that, in a way, is an answer.


Let’s move on to the Simple Son.
# {{ Page }}
## The Simple Son


So, like, I have a pretty simple question.


What is this?


[[ Stage direction: Pretend you’re handing the Seder device to the next person, then don’t ]].


I’m sorry, let me take that back. That was a(n) {{ negative adjective // bad // // idiotic}} question. I’ll try again. 


Why do we do this?


So, yeah, that was it. Simple question. And let me guess...is the answer, “we already heard the answer?” I usually get that...


I’m kinda like the plain pasta of sons. The {{ plain food // graham cracker // I am eating __  // yogurt}}. The matzah of sons, as it were.


Actually, even THAT’S too complicated. I’m a cup of white flour, scooped and eaten right out of the bag.


But if you think I’m dumb, wait til you hear from my little brother. We call him The Son Who Knows Not How To Ask.


Take it away, genius.
# {{ Page }}
## The Son Who Knows Not How to Ask


### Grib hiksy fan
Ha ray behray tel ab et terrah. tree weldicans, sming diggle {{ gibberish phrase // geng di boot wumph //  // gleg shifty tarley memdi katch ingoo}}. schlups? Fem benna ben, renna ren {{ US State // Maine // the great state of __ // New Mexico}} hen shakey.

#### Crybal mirk

# {{ Page }}
## Meta-Dayeinu
Why, that’s the best question I’ve heard all night, and there have been a LOT of questions. 


If I had heard from just the first of this obnoxious family of all sons, that would have been enough. 


If we had stopped after the second son, that would have been quite enough. Quite.


If we were to just stop reading the Haggadah right now, eat, and skip the 83 sections we have left, go home, and {{ do something you do at home // nap // // binge }}, that would be enough for us.


For our ancestors, though, long long ago in the land of Egypt, it was never enough.


No, no, our ancestors may have started as Four Sons. But those sons met Four Daughters. They got to know each other.


They multiplied. I don’t know a polite way to explain how this happened, but suffice it to say that it involved mommies and daddies, {{ items used by people who love each other // // // wedding cakes }}, {{ items used by people who hate each other // // // battle axes }}, and more than four glasses of wine.


Let’s pour out, but not drink up, some wine in honor of our multiplying ancestors, even the ones here with us tonight. So pour yourself some sederade, and sing a little song about how we used to be slaves.


בָדִים הָיִינוּ הָיִינוּ. עַתָּה בְּנֵי חוֹרִין:
Avadim hayinu. Ata b’nei chorin.


So maybe next year we should listen to the Four Daughters.
# {{ Page }}
## Better living through plagues | magid
We’ve come to the part of the Seder where we move away from questions and start getting answers. As is the tradition of Passover, we begin by reading the entire book of Exodus. You think I’m kidding. Everyone please take out your Torahs.


While you are doing that, I’ll set the scene. It’s Egypt. It’s long ago. Jews are numerous. Jews are not yet slaves.


We can skip to page {{large number // 9837 // // 9308 }} where the story gets truly {{ adjective // jolly // // riveting }}. 


Once upon a time there lived a Pharaoh named, “{{Very long and complicated name // Tikki Tikki Tembo No Sarimbo Hari Kari Bushkie Perry Pem Do Hai Kai Pom Pom Nikki No Meeno Dom Barako. // They called him____ //  Hubert Blaine Wolfeschlegelsteinhausenbergerdorff, Sr.}} but that was too complicated, so mostly the people just referred to him as “Pharaoh.”


One day, on his daily walk to  {{ geographic landmark // the Great Barrier Reef // he went to __ // Mount Rushmore}}, Pharaoh looked around and sneered, “There are so many Jews around here!  Pretty soon the lines at {{ place that is fun to go to // Six Flags  // we enjoyed going to ___ // IKEA }} will be too damn long.” Seeing a way to avert his grave problem, Pharaoh declared all Jews to be his slaves and that they spend the rest of eternity {{ undertaking a massive project // building the Great Wall of China  // they focused on ___ // terraforming Mars}}. To control their numbers, he ordered all Jewish sons be tossed into {{ body of water // the Atlantic Ocean //  __ is a body of water // Lake Michigan}}. “I call it,” he mused to his Council, “the Game of Thrown.”


# {{ Page }}
## Guns ‘n’ Moses
Some Jews were just not having this. One Jewish mother sent her new born baby, randomly named Moses, down the Nile river to save his life. “You’ll thank me later,” she called after him. 
Pharoah’s own {{ important person in one’s life // daughter // This is my __ // girlfriend}} discovered the baby and raised it right under his royal nose.


Skip 20 years, and Moses is a hip young millennial, discovering his Jewish roots and being super annoying about it. How did he first know he was Jewish, you ask? What did I tell you about questions? I don’t know, maybe it was the tingling sensation he felt when he first {{ very Jewish thing to do (past tense) // cooked latkes in synagogue // He __ // rocked out to Yentl }}. 


One day, on a leisurely stroll through the {{ gross place // // They are in the __ // mud pits}}, he witnessed an Egyptian man teasing a Jewish slave. The Egyptian said to the Jewish man {{ Immature insult // You’re ugly, stupid // He said to him, “ ___ “ // Your breath stinks }}.


Moses knew what to do. He smashed the Egytian’s head with a(n) {{ very large item // boulder // a __  // refrigerator }}. Knowing his good intentions would be misunderstood, Moses decided to flee Egypt.
# {{ Page }}
## Easter’s coming, so save our peeps!
Moses spent the ensuing decades as a care-free {{ obscure occupation // toll-booth attendant // He was a ____// liontamer}} in the land of Midian. One day, while ambling near the local shrubs, he noticed one was on fire and that the fire could talk.


“I have a burning question” the flame said. “And I’ll ask it the way I, God, always ask questions: with a command. I order you to liberate the {{ fictional race // hobbits // long ago lived an ancient race of ____ // fishpeople}} of {{ a geographic location // China //  __ is a location in the world// Burma }} and then when you finish that...you must free the Jews!” 


Moses said to God, “Am I really, like, the best person for this job?” 


“Hell no,” said God. “But Noah’s been avoiding me since the last thing I made him do, and you’re the first person I ran into. Don’t worry, I’ve got some sick tools to help you out.”


# {{ Page }}
## The Ten Plague Commandments
Moses returned to Egypt, ready to rumble. 


He ascended the royal staircase, pushed open the royal door, and wagged his staff in Pharaoh's royal face. “Let my people {{ verb, positive connotation  // pop // it likes to ___ // jiggle }}, freely”


“I think not,” Pharoah yawned.


Vanquished, Moses shrank back and started packing his bags for Midian. Suddenly, his bags burst into flames


God “Do I have to do EVERYTHING?”  


“How about we make his life miserable?” She replied.


Moses said “great!” 


# {{ Page }}


Moses returned to Egypt, ready to rumble, again. 


He ascended the royal staircase, pushed open the royal door, and wagged his staff in Pharaoh's royal face. “Let my people {{ verb, positive connotation  // pop // it likes to ___ // jiggle }}, freely or else! 


“Or else what?!” said Pharaoh


“Or else I will make your life miserable, one plague at a time...starting now”

And moses released the first of 10 plagues starting with: 
### Blood | dam


Moses turned all the water of the nile into blood.
“Why is this bad?” asked Pharoah. I drink from water bottles usually. You can’t have the jews
### Frogs | tzfardeiya
Moses released frogs all over the land of egypt.

## Dayeinu
God did so much more than the bare minimum required. GOD  is an over-acheiver.


If GOD had merely {{verb (past tense) a noun // funneled a beer// he once ___ // sat on a toilet}}, that would have been perfectly adequate.


Now if She had  {{verb (past tense) a noun // baked a cake // he once ___ // picked his nose}}, that would have been awesome.


If She had  {{verb (past tense) a noun // bit his tounge // he once ___ // farmed some vegetables}}, that would have been phenomenal.


This reminds me of a song.


STAGE DIRECTION: All sing Dayeinu.

Ilu hotzianu mi-mitzrayim, Dayeinu
If God had only taken us out of Egypt, that would have been enough!


אִלּוּ נָתַן לָֽנוּ אֶת־הַתּוֹרָה, דַּיֵּנוּ:
Ilu natan lanu et ha-Torah, Dayeinu
If God had only given us the Torah, that would have been enough.
