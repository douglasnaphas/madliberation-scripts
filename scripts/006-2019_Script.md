# Mad Liberation: Waiting for Haggadot
Let’s get a few things out of the way, just to level-set. Let’s all get on the same screen.


First of all, this is not your bubbe’s Haggadah. This is also not your bubbe’s {{ item an old person has // // // Chrysler Town and Country }}. Some things may be shocking. Others will be frustrating. Still more will be {{ adjective // // This is __ // uplifting }}.


Literally no one in the world is experiencing the very same seder that we are. Nor will anyone again. This gathering, tonight, is like {{ something that only happens once // // // the Cretaceous–Paleogene_extinction_event }}. Except we’ll actually enjoy it.
# {{ Page }}
By the end of this celebration, you will be like a free Jew, and you know how Jews love free things (but not in an offensive way). I myself love {{ something free // // I got __ // stolen train rides }}.


Imagine yourself baked into crisp matzah. Split into two pieces. Hidden. Found. Dipped, in saltwater. Washed, in preparation for the seder. Washed again, in preparation for the meal. Washed after the meal.


Eaten, like a meal. Washed down, with four glasses of wine. Thrown up, after four more. Thrown out of Egypt. Called back. Finally freed.


Anyway, let’s go over the agenda. We are going, in order, to:


קַדֵּשׁ Bless that wine | kadeish |
וּרְחַץ Wash those hands | urchatz |
כַּרְפַּס Dip those greens | karpas |
יַחַץ Break the matzah | yachatz |

מילצוש {{ Positive transitive verb // // I am going to __ that thing // Buy }} that {{ positive thing // // //  }} |.{{ a made-up Hebrew word // hirpapv // __ // basusin }} |


Let’s Jew this.

Kiddush will be kiddush | kadeish
It is tradition, indeed, it is a mitzvah, to conduct pieces of our seder in the ancient language of {{ a made-up language // Frianche // I speak __ // Getonyanese}}, which was in fact spoken by the Children of Israel when they were slaves in Egypt. For those not familiar, it sounds like this:
    {{ One phlegmy syllable (not a real word) // haechgh // __ // blech}} {{ two phlegmy syllables (not a real word) // bi-bachgh // __ // vi-vlecht}} {{ One phlegmy syllable (not a real word) // haechgh // __ // vlicht}} {{ three phlegmy syllables (not a real word) // ghamagheef // __ // gamaschische}} {{ One syllable (not a real word) // ur // __ // mi}} {{ One phlegmy syllable (not a real word) // haechgh // __ // mecht}} {{ three phlegmy syllables (not a real word) // ghamagheef // __ // vaganeeghth}}


As a secondary language, many Jews also spoke Hebrew. Much like today.


Hebrew, for its part, sounds more like this:


    בָּרוּךְ אַתָּה יְיָ, אֱלֹהֵינוּ מֶלֶךְ הָעוֹלָם, בּוֹרֵא פְּרִי הַגָּפֶן:
    Baruch Atah Adonai, Eloheinu Melech ha-olam, borei p’ree hagafen.


    בָּרוּךְ אַתָּה יְיָ, אֱלֹהֵינוּ מֶלֶךְ הָעוֹלָם,
 שֶׁהֶחֱיָנוּ וְקִיְּמָנוּ וְהִגִּיעָנוּ לַזְּמַן הַזֶּה:    
    Baruch Atah Adonai, Eloheinu Melech ha-olam,
    she-hechiyanu v’key’manu v’higiyanu lazman hazeh.


Thank you.


The prayer we just prayed thanks God for {{ a transitive culinary verb // grating // The cook is __ // squeezing }} the sacred and holy {{ fruits // melons // a bowl of __ // quinces }} She blessed ups with to make sweet wine. This wine symbolizes how sweet it is to be free from slavery, and how much more likely we are as free persons to {{ thing you enjoy doing by yourself // walk around naked // I like to __ // burp into my dog’s mouth}}. 


Be free, be sweet, be thirsty, and fill the cup of the person to your {{ left or right // left // You are to my __ // left }}.
# {{ Page }}
Shake that ass, but wash yourself | urchatz


Your hands have certainly gotten dirty sitting here all this time, especially if you’ve been {{ doing something gross //   // I was __ // slinging mud }}. So we have to cleanse them. Now. Right now. Please, for everyone’s sake.


Even washing our hands is something to be grateful for--slaves in Egypt could only wash themselves every {{ integer greater than 1 // 27 // __ > 1 // 500 }}  days.


However, because we are free, we are going to exclaim loudly, together, the sacred phrase of our ancient rabbis. But we aren’t just going to exclaim it. We’re also going to pantomime it. You heard me. To cleanse ourselves. “{{ something you get scolded to do // do the dishes //  You have to __! // wash between your toes }}!” As we excla


Alright, everybody I’m going to lead the pantomime and you are going to repeat the phrase three times. 


# {{ Page }}
Gratitude Interlude
Let’s take a pause from this busy schedule to reflect on what is meaningful in our lives. We are going to go around the room and share in 30 seconds or less. I’ll go first. Then we’ll go {{ clockwise or counterclockwise // clockwise // We will go __ // counterclockwise }}.


And that was it. That was my turn.
# {{ Page }}
When I dip, you dip, we dip a green vegetable in saltwater | karpas כַּרְפַּס


And we begin with the Hebrew again:




    בָּרוּךְ אַתָּה יְיָ, אֱלֹהֵינוּ מֶלֶךְ הָעוֹלָם, בּוֹרֵא פְּרִי הָאֲדָמָה:
    Baruch Atah Adonai, Eloheinu Melech ha-olam, borei p’ree ha-adama.
    We praise God, Ruler of Everything, who creates the fruits of the earth.


For the unknowing, be it now known that the great Muppet {{ crazy name// Laserface // This is  __ // Barko }} the {{ animal // giraffe // This is a(n)  __ // goat }} said, “It’s not easy eating greens,” especially when they’re dipped in saltwater. Yet we must. Why?


Be it known also, that according to scripture, Rabbi {{ a capitalized word, any capitalized word //  Bucket  // “__” is definitely a word // Dragon }} Bergenstein was sitting in a meadow one spring morning and pronounced:


[To the tune of “Tears on My Pillow” from Grease. If you don’t know it, make it up.]


    Tears on my parsley
     {{ negative emotion // sadness// __ // consternation }}, in my
 {{ organ // heart // __ // spleen }},
    Felt by Jews
    Oo - oo - ooo - oooo - ooooooo


And that is why we dip our green vegetable in saltwater:  to enhance the flavor of our suffering.

יַחַץ It's time for a matzah break! | yachatz


Look at all this sumptuous matzah before us. Everyone, seriously look. Imagine yourself eating it. Seriously, everyone: imagine. That’s all you get to do, because we’re not eating now. 


We’re breaking. 


Someone locate the piles of matzah on the table. They could be resting under a napkin, inside your grandma’s lacquered matzah box, or hiding in {{ person or people in this room and something that belongs to them // Josh’s Lunchbox  // this is  __ // Michael’s mouth }}. When the moment comes, I will assign someone to take the middle matzah from this pile and to render it in two. The larger half (how can one half be larger? This might be the 5th question!) shall be passed to me. I will {{ adverb // hungrily //  do it  __ // wretchedly}} hide this bounty as the afikomen, which literally translates to: gift of the {{ adjective // lovely //  a(n)  __ thing // flimsy }}  {{ thing // grocery bag //  this is a(n)  __ // handjob}}.
After dinner, all you guests will have to hunt for this afikomen  and win a prize. What could it be? A trip to {{ very descriptive place // the most fly-ridden dump in Kansas  // going to __ // the gates of Hell }}?  A hot and heavy, yet romantic evening with {{ a person at this Seder // Josh  // __ is at this Seder  // Vinny }}? An annuity payment of {{ small number that is not one // two // __  // three }}  shekels in your bank account over the next {{ number greater than ten // three-hundred and four // __  // seventy }} {{ units of time // years // __  // minutes }}? You get to pick! 


Remember the greatest rabbinical maxim: “a good thing will come to ye who search for it”. 


At last, our moment has come. There is no blessing. There is no curse. There is just the snapping of the unleavened bread...Go!

Pre-magid
Have you ever wondered why you are not a slave today? Have you ever wondered why, instead of {{ transitive verb // punishing   // you are __ it // licking }} your Master’s {{ thing // bagel  // the __  // horseshoes}} every day, you get to do whatever you please, as long as you’re working?


The reason for your freedom lies is this holy tale. It is a hymn of {{ characteristic or emotion // courage  // a person of great __  // dignity}} and {{ characteristic or emotion // courage  // a person of great __   // nudity }}, of how the hero of the Hebrews risked everything to free everyone, with nothing but his mighty staff and a little help from an omnipotent friend. And it begins shortly. 


But before we begin anything, we must always think of the children, for we were children once and were thought over...


...and kids say the darndest things, am I right? Especially when they are forced to say things in Hebrew. Good thing we don’t have any kids here. Kids ask so many questions, like {{ a dumb question // Is the moon made of cheese? //  __ ? // What happens if I fall into my bellybutton? }}


# {{ Page: To Youngest }}
Ahem.
# {{ Page: From Youngest }}
Didn’t see you there! You are so small! Well, since you’re here, we might as well put you to work. Now, almost all of us know the entire history of the {{ holiday or great day //passover // we celebrate  __ // St Patrick’s Day }} but I’m sure this {{ immature insult you’d use to insult a kid// bubble butt //you are a ____//fish vomit stick}} has some questions about it. 


Let us hear from that who is the FURTHEST in age from Israel. 
# {{ Page: To Youngest }}
Thank you family. First off let me say that I am not uneducated. In fact, I was the one who first theorized the {{a name of a made up theory// the scientific month//Edison thought of the___ theory//Flabby Billy Theory}} theory. 


But I do have some questions And when I have questions, I like to sing them in perfect Hebrew.  




מַה נִּשְׁתַּנָּה הַלַּֽיְלָה הַזֶּה מִכָּל הַלֵּילוֹת?
Ma nishtana halaila hazeh mikol haleilot?


שֶׁבְּכָל הַלֵּילוֹת אָֽנוּ אוֹכְלִין חָמֵץ וּמַצָּה. הַלַּֽיְלָה הַזֶּה כֻּלּוֹ מַצָּה:

Maror.

 הַלַּֽיְלָה הַזֶּה כֻּלָּֽנוּ מְסֻבִּין:
Shebichol haleilot anu ochlin bein yoshvin uvein m’subin.
Halaila hazeh kulanu m’subin.


I know you’re all as old as  {{something old // A dinosaur // My grandpa is as old as ____ // Stonehenge}}and might not speak Hebrew, so I’ll translate that for you.


I said, why is this night different from all other nights? I mean, I usually do the exact same thing every night, specifically, I {{ weird ritual you might do // brush my teeth with a pencil // Every night, I ____// gargle coffee to the tune of “Row, Row, Row Your Boat”}}, every night, but tonight, I’m here with you. Why?
# {{ Page: From Youngest }}
Different how? Like apples and {{ plural noun // killer whales // Those are ____! // boogers}}? Can you be more specific? 


# {{ Page: To Youngest }}
Well, for instance, on all other nights I eat leavened bread and {{type of food//apple pie//I love to eat ____!//flan}}, but tonight I’m only eating matzah. And like nine other courses. Why?


# {{ Page: From Youngest }}
Have you ever tried to build pyramids while eating three square meals a day? I don’t think so! Our slave ancestors ate matzah because they had no time to {{ action that doesn’t take a long time // sneeze // Some people can ____ in five seconds. // put on socks }}, let alone wait for yeast to rise. What’s your next question, {{ term of endearment // sweet potato // I call my husband ____. // sugar lumpkin }}?
# {{ Page: To Youngest }}
On every other night I eat tons of vegetables. TONS. Here are a few of the vegetables I eat daily: {{ type of vegetable//broccoli // My mom served me ____!// green beans }}, {{ type of vegetable//broccoli//My mom served me ____! // peas }}, {{ type of obscure vegetable // parsnip // My mom served me ____!// cabbage }}.But tonight I’m only eating bitter herbs! Why?
# {{ Page: From Youngest }}
Well, you see little young one, once we were slaves, and being a slave is very {{ word for disgusting // putrid // That old milk smells ___! // horrible }}, just like bitter herbs. Not like vegetables though...which are delightful.  


# {{ Page: To Youngest }}
Speaking of vegetables, why on this night do I dip my vegetables not just once but  {{ large number// 349 // He counted up to  ____!// 3958}} times. That’s so many times! 
# {{ Page: From Youngest }}
It’s just twice. But yes. On this night we dip twice because our ancestors were slaves, and that’s sad. So we dip in salt water, which represents their tears. Also because dipping is luxurious like {{luxurious activity // being fed grapes // When I want to feel fancy, I spend my days  ____. // bathing in gold coins}}, so there is that. 


# {{ Page: To Youngest }}
Ok last question. I promise. On all other nights I don’t recline. I sit up as straight as a {{stiff object // board // stiff as a ___ || wall}}. Why on this night do I get to recline on a {{soft object // pillow // soft as a ___ || fluffy bed}}?


# {{ Page: From Youngest }}




It’s because we’re FREE. You see we can do anything we want now. I can go into a deli and {{ Activity you’d do if there were no laws // rob a bank // If you ___, you will go to jail. // moon a diner waiter }} now. And so can you! And that’s the underlying message here.


Anyway, thank you, youngest person here, for your astute questions. You may go to bed.
