## The bad old days
Have you ever been to a seder where someone says, “Stop looking at your phone”?

Here is another lib, coming at you like {{ something fast and heavy // // This is _ // a damn lib }}.

Well, this is fun. It’s important for a haggadah to span multiple pages, like a textual {{ long thing // // This is a _ // snake }}.

    Claude Monet
    You can {{ verb // // I like to _ // read him }} {{ adverbial phrase that rhymes with “day” // in this way // I will smile _ // every-which-a-way }}
    Seders are fine
    Good haggadahs have to rhyme
