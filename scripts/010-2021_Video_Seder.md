# Mad Liberation 2021

## Call to order

Is everyone on? {{ Something people say at the start of video calls. // Can everyone hear me? //  // Am I muted? Where am I? }} Everyone turn your camera on, so I know you’re not {{ doing something you shouldn't do on a video call // texting your ex // When you're on a video call, you should not be _. // eating before we're allowed to }}.

So, how about this pandemic, right? I’ll tell ya. {{ Something people say about the pandemic // I can't wait for this to be over! //  // Wearing a mask is an act of love. Wearing two, is even better. }}. In times like this, it is vital that we stay hopeful, {{ do something that is crucial to keeping our sanity in the pandemic // Maintain multiple lively group texts with some overlap between them //  // go for the same walk through our cute little neighborhood for the millionth time }}, and that we remember {{ a hopeful sentiment // Our life stories and the story of the universe are written with the same hand // Just remember: _. // In Jewish history there are no coincidences. }}. To that end, we are gathered here to honor the ancestors and recite their traditions, because they put up with even more {{ bad things // crap // I'm sick of all this _. // malarkey }} than us.

# {{ Page }}

That’s right, it’s…

## Passover!

{{ The onomatopoeic sound of a trumpet // Duh-duh-de-de-deh-DUH-duh-DUH!!! // Trumpets be like, "_." // Broo-broop-BOOO!!! }} What’s up, fam? {{ Something a hype man would say // Let's get ready to RUMBLE!!! //  // Do you feel it???? I said, "Do you FEEL it????" }}. We have a packed agenda, so I’m just gonna jump right in, after some interesting trivia about the historical origins of Passover.

### Proto-Passover: Multiple Spring Flings

Back in the day, like back back in the day, like back when {{ Something that happened an extremely long time ago // the Indus River valley was discovered // This was way back when _. // people had gills }}, pre-Moses, there were two spring festivals. The first, {{ A name for an extremely ancient Spring Festival (much older than Passover) // the binding of Gilgamesh in Pastels  // The extremely ancient ones celebrated  _. // Spring Fest 2,000,000 BC }}, celebrated {{ a natural phenomenon that happens in early spring // the buds budding on the trees // Each spring I notice _. // lambs being born }}. The second, {{ A name for an extremely ancient festival celebrating a natural occurrence // the Harvest of the Jurassic Ferns  //  // the Dance of Neolithic Sorghum  }}, commemorated the rebirth of {{ something that happens each spring // the buds budding on the trees // I like to see _. // squirrels mating }}. Some scholars disagree with this hypothesis.

Today, we celebrate one consolidated Spring Festival: Passover. Passover is beloved around the world because {{ A reason Passover is so popular today // people love matzah // Passover is popular today because _. // it means Saint Patrick's Day is over }}, and because it brings one night of order to chaotic families, as we shall see.

## Agendums

You may not conform to a gender, but tonight you will conform to an agenda. We are all conformists for God. You will also sing the agenda for we are all {{ a famous singer // Mavis Staples //  // Gloria Estefan }} in the eyes of God. And our song goes:

[[Sing the following. If you don’t know the tune, an informed Jew at this seder will probably rescue you.]]

## The first cup of wine | Kadeish

Many of the most important things in life come in groups of four. Tonight we will drink or fake-drink four cups of wine, and this number, four, will speak to us in many ways.

Depending on who you ask, the four cups may symbolize:

1. Sarah, Rebecca, Rachel, and Leah, the matriarchs of Judaism

2. {{ Something good that comes in a group of four // the Beatles: John, Paul, George, and Ringo //  // episodes one through four of the Home Alone film series }}

3. The four promises that God made to the Jews: I will bring you out, I will deliver you, I will redeem you, {{ A promise that God would make to his people // I will deliver you to the land of milk and honey //  // I will condemn you to a life of persecution }}

4. {{ Four things that define your life // Cats, poetry, running, and song //  // Eating, hand cream, sports, and one day settling Mars }}.

The time for the first cup of wine is almost upon us. If you don’t have Passover wine at your house, you can either pretend or drink a full glass of {{ a liquid //  //  // Tang }}.

Let us bless before we imbibe.

בָּרוּךְ אַתָּה יְיָ, אֱלֹהֵינוּ מֶלֶךְ הָעוֹלָם, בּוֹרֵא פְּרִי הַגָּפֶן:

    Baruch Atah Adonai, Eloheinu Melech ha-olam, borei p’ree hagafen.

    בָּרוּךְ אַתָּה יְיָ, אֱלֹהֵינוּ מֶלֶךְ הָעוֹלָם,

    שֶׁהֶחֱיָנוּ וְקִיְּמָנוּ וְהִגִּיעָנוּ לַזְּמַן הַזֶּה:

    Baruch Atah Adonai, Eloheinu Melech ha-olam,

    she-hechiyanu v’key’manu v’higiyanu lazman hazeh.

Let us imbibe.

## The first hand-washing | Urchatz

There is no activity more emblematic of the times we live in this year than {{ an activity popularized by Covid-19 // going pants-less for work meetings // Since Covid we've been _  // hugging each other back to back }}. But washing hands is a close second. In some traditions, sedergoers even wash each others’ hands, which, like {{ a way that you can love another as yourself // showing them compassion // I vow to love others as myself by _. // including them when you order takeout }}, is a way you can love another as yourself. Not a bad idea.

### A note on playing pretend | Leha’amid Panim

In this and other sections, because of our virtual format, we are not going to literally do the actions as the ancients did. We are going to pretend. That is due, of course, to Lady Necessity.

So let us all pretend to wash our hands. Don’t forget {{ an important component of washing your hands // singing “I Will Survive,” to make sure you wash long enough // when you wash your hands, don’t forget  _. // the wrists }}, otherwise we can all assume the next outbreak of {{ a bizarre disease // amoebic dysentery  // a case of ___ // diptheria}} will start at your house.

[[Pantomime washing your hands.]]

You’re clean! Well, cleaner than you were. How will you utilize your newfound state of purity? One of us is going to utilize their newfound state of purity by {{ how you will utilize your newfound state of purity // strutting around town so everyone can see Clean Me // I will utilize my newfound state of purity by _. // touching everything }}.

# {{ Page }}

Dipping a spring vegetable in water | Karpas

If you’re a {{ type of vegetable, doing something vegetables do // cucumber, suspended in fancy water //  // P.O.T.A.T.O. (Person Over Thirty Acting Twenty-One) }}, this is where you start to get nervous. Or excited. Or just wet.

Holding our spring veggies closely reminds us to pay attention to the season, to have gratitude for {{ a good thing that happens in the spring, in purple prose // magnolias puckering their petals toward the sun // What I appreciate about spring is_ // dragonflies dancing in the cool April rains }}.

Let us take a moment for gratitude. We will go around the virtual seder now, each of us saying something for which we are grateful. I will start.

[[Take turns, each saying something you’re grateful for.]]

Ok, back to me. If you are so blessed as to have a vegetable and some saltwater handy, please get ready to dip.

If you don’t have saltwater, then just think of {{ something cringeworthy // the last time you licked a subway floor //  // making out with someone while their teeth were falling out into your mouth }} and cry into a cup. If you don’t have a vegetable, grab {{ something that is almost like a vegetable, but not quite // a shrubbery // // a tomato }}. Or just pretend.

Saltwater reminds us of the tears shed by the ancestors, as well as the tears shed by those suffering today and those who are still in bondage. We sitting here are grateful for our freedom, but we must remember that there are many others in this world who still are not.

    בָּרוּךְ אַתָּה יְיָ, אֱלֹהֵינוּ מֶלֶךְ הָעוֹלָם, בּוֹרֵא פְּרִי הָאֲדָמָה:

    Baruch Atah Adonai, Eloheinu Melech ha-olam, borei p’ree ha-adama.

    We praise God, Ruler of Everything, who creates the fruits of the earth.

And we conclude with the words of the mid-14th century Danish poet laureate {{ a very Danish-sounding name // Jaap de Hoop Scheffer //  // Agard Agnar Amudssen }}:

O knave! Stew thy {{ a vegetable // beet // I ate a(n)__ // eggplant }} in a brackish pool!

{{ a phrase describing something you do that ends in a word rhyming with "pool" // jump for joy on a little stool //  // turn around and act a fool }}

Spring is here, it is at the door

{{ a short proverb, piece of advice, or a wise saying, that ends in a word rhyming with "door" // kiss your heart, for it is pure //  // Finish up, and ask for more }}

## Yachatz | Breaking the matzah

# {{ Page }}

Somebody here must have matzah. At the very least, someone must know how to PRETEND to have matzah. If we can’t find matzah, we will just have to break {{ a person here at this seder // Doug //  // Vinny }}’s {{ prized possession // family safe// I treasure my _  // custom gold-inlaid ceramic seder plate }} instead.

Either way, let’s do that now. Somebody volunteer with matzah they’re willing to break, or somebody volunteer to pretend to break matzah. Now.

[[Stage direction: All bear witness as your volunteer breaks matzah, or pretends to.]]

Chance always picks a favorite. Consider {{ someone lucky, and the reason they are lucky // Jeff Bezos, because he’s so rich //  // a four-time lottery winner, sitting on a trillion dollars }}. Though our holy volunteer has attempted to break the matzah into even pieces, they have failed, because {{ something that happens that proves life is not fair // young birds eat their weaker brothers //  // packaging makes food taste better }}, and life is not fair. Because one half of our shattered matzah is inevitably bigger, we will call it the Afikoman, which means “{{ something that is often hidden // an extra key //  // grandma’s money }}” in the ancient tongue. Our volunteer will hide this larger half, because more is hidden in life than is revealed. It’s better that way.

[[Stage direction: All look away as your volunteer hides the Afikoman in their own home, or pretends to.]]

Now we are all having a good time here at this {{ another term for a seder // Super Supper // We are gathered here tonight for a _. // Matzah Ball }}, but several hours from now, it will all end. And when that happens, we must passover the conviviality of our meal and return to suffering with a miserable snack. We snack in such fashion to remind us of all our toils. So it is good that we prepared our snacky sacrament just now.

# Pre-Pre Magid - What’s the deal with our freedom?

Have you ever noticed that you’re not enslaved? Have you ever wondered why, instead of {{ verb ending in -ing // punishing   // you are __ it // licking }} your master’s {{ things someone purchases // bagels  // I bought some __  // horseshoes}} every day, you get to {{ a thing you do in your spare time // chop wood without a shirt // I like to ___ // pressure-cook beans }} and {{ a thing you would like to do // listen to music // i am happy to ___ // stretch my toes }} whenever you please?

The answer lies in this holy tale. It is a hymn of {{ characteristic or emotion // courage  // a person of great __  // dignity}} and extreme {{ characteristic or emotion // courage  // a person of great __   // nudity }}, of how the hero of the Hebrews risked everything to free his people, with nothing but his mighty {{ something long // obelisk // that is a long ___ // broomstick }} and a little help from an omnipotent friend. And we will tell this story {{ a moment in time // now // we will celebrate this ___ // next year }}.

Before we do anything that gets us closer to eating, we must think about why we are here...

# # {{ Page }}

# Pre-magid - The REAL Questions

[[Stage direction: Identify the youngest individual present, and cede control of the seder them. They read the following:]]

I love being a baby. I love {{ an advantage of being a baby // getting to wear diapers // // drinking from spill-proof cups }}, and I’m really glad I miss out on {{ something bad about being an adult // having to go to work //  // having to deal with babies }}.

I’m not sure I understand…

[[Stage direction: Gesture around the virtual room.]]

This.

What are we doing? {{ a question a child would ask // where do babies come from? // ___? // when is dinner? }}? {{ a ridiculous question // why is your mouth full of coal? // ___? // who dealt it? }}? Sorry, it’s my first Passover.

I know these are tough questions, so we’d better all sing them together, in Hebrew, so all you ancients can understand.

    מַה נִּשְׁתַּנָּה הַלַּֽיְלָה הַזֶּה מִכָּל הַלֵּילוֹת?

    Ma nishtana halaila hazeh mikol haleilot?

    Maror.

    Halaila hazeh kulanu m’subin.

Translation:

Why do we eat {{ adjective // burnt // this is ___ // befuddled }} bread?

Why do we eat herbs so {{ unpleasant descriptive language // disgusting // ew, it’s ___ // nasty }}?

Why do we dip not once, but as often as {{ something that happens frequently // I check my phone //  // badgers jump in trash }}?

Why do we recline, and not {{ verb phrase // swim the English Channel // he likes to __ // staple papers }} all night long?

[[Stage direction: Youngest, yield control back to the grown-up who yielded unto thee.]]

# Pre-Post-Pre-Magid - Answering the Questions

Well, kid, here is the long and short of it: We were slaves in {{ a place // a park // here is ___ // a vestibule }} in ancient {{ a municipality or country // Beijing // i live in ___ // Philadelphia }} or something like that.

We got free and now we are grateful. What we will never be free of, however, is having to tell this story.

# Post-Pre-Magid: Think of the Children!

So as we’ve seen, kids today are confused by many things, like {{ something in today’s world that confuses kids // how cell phones work // Kids are confused by _ // the fact that some adults throw tantrums instead of doing what they’re told }} or {{ a concept or behavior that confuses kids // why praying mantises eat their mates // Kids are confused by _ // how gravity works }}. And so they have questions. We’re about to hear from four of them.

1. Kid One is {{ a high-born sounding name // Eggleton // __ is my name // Cordelia }} the {{ adjective  // praiseworthy // it is ___ // polymorphic }} {{ professional title // doctor // i got hired as a(n) ___ // executive director }}. They represent all that is wise.

2. Kid Two is {{ an unpleasant-sounding name // Wormtail // __ is my name // Barfneck }} the {{ negative adjective // disgusting // unfortunately, it is ___ // horrible }} {{ a singular thing // bag // it is a(n) ___ // ulcer }}. They manifest all that is wicked.

3. Kid Three is {{ a monosyllabic name // Tess // __ is my name // Kirk }} the {{ past participle // regurgitated // he has ___ it // eaten }} {{ container of something and the thing it contains // box of marbles // it is a(n) ___ // bag of doritos }}. They are but a simple presence here.

4. Kid Four, everyone’s favorite (sorry), is {{ thing // raisin // this is a ___ // Shovel }} the {{ adjective // heavy // it is ___ // corny }} {{ animal // ostrich // look at the ___ // whale }}. They don’t know why they are here.

Let us exploit their questioning nature to teach them about Passover.

## # {{ Page }}

## The Wise Child’s Question

{{ A pretentious greeting // Good morrow, Lord Farthington //  // Salutations, good citizen }}, I am the Wise Child. I have accomplished much. In fact, I should be at {{ somewhere a very good child goes // piano practice //  // Wise Child Day School }} right now.

Last year, I {{ took an intelligent action // cracked the code //  // hacked the mainframe }}. Last month, I {{ did something noble // liberated the nation //  // found the hypotenuse }}. And just yesterday, when {{ there was a problem // the sky was falling // We were afraid because ___. // the invaders invaded }}, I saved the WORLD by {{ solving a problem // healing the sick // I was __. // finding the missing }}.

One trembles to think what I might achieve when I reach adulthood.

I doubt any of you understand the significance of my actions, or how they have contributed to the growing body of {{ elite subject matter // pre-natal brain development // I wrote a paper on ___ // post-revolution cannibalism }} theory. Nonetheless, {{ a belittling name // Hot Shot // Listen, __ // Peck }}, I will humor you, by asking you a question, so you feel included, and smart like me, for once in your life.

What are the statutes, testimonies, laws, and {{ exercises // push-ups // I was doing ___. // social dances }} that God has commanded us to do?

Again, I know the answers, I am asking so I can judge your knowledge and hear how the common folk talk.

# {{ Page }}

## The Wise Answer

Wise child, sit down. I got this. On the most BASIC level, God commands us to {{ take an action // create a file // I am going to __ // lift the puppy }} BEFORE we {{ take an action // make a cake // I am going to __ // screw the pooch }}. This means that one may not EVER {{ take an action // sing // I am going to ___. // leave the chamber }} AFTER {{ an event // the shrew parade // I attended ___. // the taming of the shrew }}. I know that sounds complicated, but fortunately there are three categories of sub-laws to clarify God’s position. They are:

### Chukim

These are the most unreasonable and nonsensical laws that you would never generate on your own, like “don’t mix wool with linen” and, “ {{ A weird piece of advice // Don’t put BBQ sauce in your pants //  // Always sit on the butter before you eat it }},” and of course, {{ An inexplicably strange law // Don’t use paper in February // // Don’t churn butter in the bathroom }}.

### Edot

These are the reasonable-but-not-necessarily intuitive laws, like {{ an obscure, but reasonable biblical law // thou shalt milk the cow three times // ___ // honor thy neighbor's garbage }}. These also encompass laws commanding you to celebrate Shabbat, Festivals, and Important Rites of Passage, such as {{ a rite of passage // learning to ride a bike //  // the first time eating solid food }}.

### Mishpatim

These are the Intuitive Laws, like don’t get caught murdering, stealing, or {{ something you’d probably get in trouble for if you were caught by your parents // watching too much TV // I got grounded for__ // punching your brother in his private parts}}.

Do you get it now?? The laws of Pesach should make total sense to you at this point...

## # {{ Page }}

## The Wicked Child’s Question

{{ An annoying thing to say to get attention // Yo, losers! // ___ // Pickle my feet, Piglets! }}!

I don’t care about you or any of my so-called people! All I wanna do is {{ take an action // sell stocks // I am going to ___ // hunt pandas }}, and eat {{ something edible // buttercream // he will eat___ // nutter butters }} in my {{ something you own // hat // check out my __ // socks }}.

Hey, {{ someone here at this Seder //  //  // Pete}}, you look like you just crawled out of {{ a place // The National Constitution Center // __ is a place // Marsden's toilet }} and {{ someone in this videoconference //  //  // Andi }} you look like you just got done {{ verb ending in -ing // swimming // look at it, ___ over there // prancing }} on {{ a place something could rest on // the dining room table // he put it on ___ // Lincoln's upper lip }}.

So why should a {{ a living or non-living thing // peach tree // it is a(n) __ // weasel }} like me care about Passover?

And what’s up with these so called “commands?” And who is making us do all this - , {{ someone who gives or has given commands // the chief of police //  // Genghis Khan }}? Like, why do i have to {{ A complaint in present tense // go to school today // I am annoyed because I have to ____ // take my grandmother to church}} tonight?

What does all this mean to YOU?!

## # {{ Page }}

## The Wicked Answer

Wicked child, you are not part of the tribe. We would all make {{ something not solid // gelatin // ___ is not solid // soup }} of your {{ body parts // organs // he has __ // bones }} if we could. We already regret inviting you, for you are the worst of all children. You are worse than {{ a villain // Pol Pot // ___ is a horrible character // Haman }}, but still, we are blessed you are here.

It is important to question the meaning of things like why {{ a phenomenon that occurs // the sun rises  // i have always wondered why __ // my belt buckle breaks after eating }} or why {{ plural noun // donkeys // those are ___ // elves }} {{ verb in present tense // deliver // they __ it // tickle }} all the {{ plural noun // green cans // those are ___ // fish }} in the back of {{ someone here at this Seder //  //  // Doug}}’s {{ something a person owns // little black box // look at my __ // garage}}

BUT it is MORE important that you blindly follow nonsensical biblical commands lest you be killed by a vengeful deity.

So do whatever God says.

Let’s move on to your Simpler Sibling.

## # {{ Page }}

## The Simple Child’s Question

{{ something you say when you don’t know what to say // um….err... // __ .... // Uhhhhh……...ummmmmm….. }}. I’m the Simple Child.

I have a really easy question. I think.

{{ An extremely easy question, the answer to which everyone knows or should know // // // Which came first, the chicken, or the Big Bang? }}

I’m sorry, let me slightly rephrase that: {{ An extremely basic, fundamental question // // // What is this? }} You know what I mean?

So, yeah, that was it. Simple question. And let me guess...the answer is, {{ a singular thing (without "a" or "the") // lemon //  // bag }} I was going to guess that...

So, I’m kinda like the plain pasta of sons. The {{ plain food // graham cracker // I am eating __  // yogurt}} of sons...some real matzah boy soup.

Actually, that’s too complicated. I’m more like a cup of white flour, scooped and eaten right out of the bag.

Got {{ things you would find at a Seder // lamb shanks //  // bitter herbs }}?

## # {{ Page }}

## The Simple Answer

Young {{ an enlightened person or being // Confucius//  // Tom Cruise }}, I believe these are the answers you seek:

First, it was always {{ something doing something // a frog eating a fly // yesterday, I saw  __ // my uncle Joe reading the newspaper }}

Second, {{ adjective + noun // green clay // look at that ___ // simple syrup }} can be used to {{ do something to something // play a piano // it can be used to _ // drive the passengers home }} even if you never thought there’d be time for it.

Third, Passover.

Pick the answer that inspires you most, and then let’s hear from your sibling, the child who learned how to {{ action requiring a high degree of skill // cut diamonds // she mastered how to __ // write a novel }} before they learned how to ask questions.

## # {{ Page }}

## The Child-Who-Knows-Not-How-to-Ask-a-Question’s Question

This is more of a comment, really. I have been waiting all year to show you what’s in my brain.

For starters, hair eh bear eh tell abbot hoorah. Teereh ma! Then, {{ an emphatic command // come hither! //  // sell the boat and pay down your debt! }}

This, of course, brings in the issue of {{ a nonsense phrase one might shout loudly // Schlupps! SCHLUPPS! // // GOOG BOOG!! }}.

And as a counter-point, Ding Ding, biggle diggle {{ US City // Las Vegas // the great city of __ // Indianapolis}}?.

Some, however, would argue {{ a series of rhyming mono-syllablic sounds // moo gloo poo //  // yum thumb numb grum }} until the cows come home

But if you REALLY think about it {{ gibberish paragraph // Yurm girdle noot noot, sling a sling, gree gulla fee. Grob joppa. Glee sum pordum ug lee ensteys. Mistro feep bunto rom endy cligh. //  // phlung bistro ming nota}} wellwalla {{ famous artists // Henri Matisse //  // Katy Perry}}

Butta cling {{ character in book or movie // Peter Pan // // Cinderella}} mish bibbity Passover?!

## # {{ Page }}

## Meta-Dayeinu

Why, that’s the best question we’ve heard all night, and there have been a LOT of questions!

If we had heard from just the first of these obnoxious children, that would have been enough.

If we had stopped after the second child, that would definitely have been enough!

If we were to stop reading this Haggadah right now, eat our meal, and then say to one another: “{{ something you say at the end of a conference call //  //  // let's circle back; I have a hard stop }}”, and then go off and {{ do something you do at home // take a nap // // binge Netflix }}, that would be enough for us. In fact, anything more might be too much.

However, for our ancestors long, long ago in the land of Egypt, it was never enough. So let’s do them this honor, lift our glasses, which by now should be full of {{ a liquid // gasoline // ___ is a liquid // plasma }}, and sing a little song about how we used to be slaves.

בָדִים הָיִינוּ הָיִינוּ. עַתָּה בְּנֵי חוֹרִין:

    Avadim hayinu. Ata b’nei chorin.

Translation: We were once slaves in Egypt, but now we are free.

Except you are NOT free to drink this cup. Put it down and let’s take a walk down memory lane...

# {{ Page }}

#### The Mad Liberation | magid

Blessedly, we have reached the part of the seder that always stays the same, like {{ something that always stays the same // the sands upon the dunes //  // Pope Constantine }}. The story of Moses and his good deeds is the same whether told in person, {{ in a place // at the drive-in // I am __. // in Florence }}, via {{ an artistic medium // oil on canvas // I am an artist, and my medium is _. // power ballad }}, or on a video call.

Long ago, being a Jew was as hard as {{ something difficult // wrapping a present perfectly //  // grinding coffee beans with a nutcracker }}, because {{ the reason it was hard to be a Jew in ancient Egypt // we had to do all the real work //  // we had to make brick with no straw, whatever that means }}. Indeed, we were enslaved, and all because the wicked Pharaoh feared {{ something about the Jews that made Pharaoh afraid // our anti-Pharaoh spray // Pharaoh was afraid of _. // the Almighty’s favoritism towards us }}. Pharaoh thought he was {{ the occupant of an enviable position // the coolest kid in school //  // the king of kings }}, because he had {{ done something that you have to do to become Pharaoh // scored well on the Pharaoh aptitude test // He was only Pharaoh because he had _. // arranged the assassination of his siblings }}.

Fortunately, right about the time that {{ something that happened in history elsewhere in the world right around the time that Moses was born // corn was invented // // dinosaurs grew fur and turned into mammals }} a hero whose name rhymes with “{{ phrase that rhymes with Moses // noses for roses //  // Let my people go, sis }}” was born who would grow up to fix everything, and then some.

## # {{ Page }}

## Moses: the Early Years

Because {{ a means of family planning // illustrated pamphlets, handed out in middle school // // girls’ education }} hadn’t been invented yet, Pharaoh condemned all baby Jewish boys to death by {{ a gruesome fate // being buried alive in compost // They were condemned to death by _. // being fed to the chimpanzees }}.

Well, some Jews were just not having it - in particular, Yocheved the Virtuous, who was pregnant with You Know Who.

Pharoah’s goons were present when she went into labor. The instant the child launched from her fertile crescent, she cried out, “Look! {{ something shocking // two bears fighting //  // The end of the World }} !! ”, and sent her newborn straight down the Nile on a boat made from {{ items // toothbrushes //  // ironing boards }}.

Pharaoh’s daughter discovered the boy in question while making her ablutions, and named him Moses, and adopted him. “{{ Something a woman would say to explain why she decided to adopt a child as a single mother // “I am just at a place in my life where I’m sick of waiting” //  // “I don’t need a man. I need a boy.” }},” she said.

Skip 20 years, and Moses is a hip young millennial, discovering his Jewish roots and being super annoying about it. How did he first know he was Jewish, you ask? What did I tell you about questions? I don’t know, maybe it was the tingling sensation he felt when he first {{ very Jewish thing to do (past tense) // cooked latkes in synagogue // He __ // rocked out to Yentl }} or the joy he experienced every time he {{ did something a few times in the past that was very Jewish // blew shofars during weekend retreats // He often  __ // read the Torah }}

One day, on a leisurely stroll through the palace {{ gross place // // They are in the __ // mud pits}}, he witnessed an Egyptian man teasing a Jewish slave. The Egyptian said to the Jewish man, “{{ A Shakespearean insult // Away, you starvelling, you elf-skin, you dried neat’s-tongue, bull’s-pizzle, you stock-fish! //  // Go, prick thy face, and over-red thy fear, Thou lily-liver’d boy. }}.”

Moses knew what to do. He smashed the Egytian’s head with a(n) {{ very large item // boulder // a __  // refrigerator }}.

That went over about as well as {{ something unpopular // pineapple on pizza //  // beans on toast }}.

Moses took full responsibility. He issued the following statement, “{{ A speech you would give to accept full responsibility // I want to address concerns over my recent actions. First and foremost, I accept full responsibility. I regret what I have done, and I wholeheartedly apologize to anyone who might have been hurt. //  // Mistakes were made. }}”. The Egyptians forgave him, Egyptian-style, by chasing him out to Midian under threat of {{ something you could be threatened with // getting slapped // He was chased out under threat of _. // being fed to the hens }}.

## A Mission of Manumission

Now let’s get to the point. Moses was {{ doing something // walking to the mailbox // // eating pears }}, and he saw {{ an item that should NOT be on fire // a house // That is _, and it is on fire, so I’m upset. // a MacBook Pro }} on fire. Even worse, it spoke:

{{ Something God says to introduce Himself // Bonjour, I am God. //  // Bow down to Me and only Me. Hello. }}.

God continued:

Get thee back to Egypt, and free the Jews.

Moses said to God, “My skills mostly lie in {{ a strange area of skill // the arts of war // … is skilled in __. // balancing things on other things }}. Am I really, like, the best person for this job?”

God retorted:

I will do literally all the work.

All you have to do is speak

Moses retorted, “But...{{ An excuse // The dog ate my homework // // I have a hard stop at 3:30}}.”

God commanded:

It will be easy.

Just repeat what I say.

Moses said, “What I say. What I say. What I...”

God cut him off:

I mean to Pharaoh.

I’ll explain a plague to you,

And you’ll explain it to him.

Go now.

{{ Logistical instructions from God to Moses // When you go to see Pharaoh, wear something dignified, but not too dignified. //  // Pack a staff. }}

### # {{ Page }}

### Blood | dam

Moses moseyed into Pharaoh’s hall and introduced the coming plagues by saying, “{{ A polite way of telling people you're about to turn the river into blood // Sir, I apologize, but I am about to turn your river gently into blood //  // Drink blood, my good sir }}”.

And then there was blood.

Pharoah delighted in the novelty that first week, but he got sick of receiving complaints of his people having to {{ do something people normally do with water // bathe //  // take their probiotics }} with blood or cook their {{ something you cook in water // couscous //  // kidney beans }} with it.

Pharaoh, though, still had water, as everyone’s blood had been turned into water, so he could just cut off someone’s head and brush his teeth if he wanted. Moreover, changing the river into blood was a well-known Egyptian parlour trick, like {{ a parlour trick // //  // turning your tongue upside-down }}. So Pharaoh went back to {{ doing a leisure activity // reclining on plush couches // // playing golf with his attorney }}, and the Jews remained enslaved.

### # {{ Page }}

### Plague Combo One: Brogs (tzfardeiya) and Lice (kinim)

### With renewed determination, so spake Moses “{{ An ominous statement // Prepare for the worst //  // To thee, this day, I send a thousand travails }}”.

### Suddenly, there were frogs {{ inside a place where you wouldn’t want to find frogs // in your underwear // I’m upset because there are frogs  _. // in the dishwasher }} and {{a place upon which you would be upset to find frogs // on every credenza // I can’t believe there are frogs _. // on the dining room table }} and {{ a place behind or underneath which you would be upset to find frogs // under mother’s robes // I am shocked there are frogs _. // behind the fertility statues}}.

### That wasn’t terrible.

### But things didn’t get better when God said, “Let there be Lice!” and every single speck of Eygptian dirt morphed into lice. What was once {{ something dirty // gardening gloves, after a day in the garden // _ is dirty. // my shoes, after a strenuous hike }} crawled with vermin. Lice danced {{ in a place where one wouldn’t want lice  // around your neck // wouldn’t want lice _. // in my mouth }} {{ places that can get dirty // children’s rooms //  // kitchen cabinets }} were now bursting with lice, instead of dirt. The dirty dishes were now licey dishes. Sand castles became lice castles.

### “My king,” pleaded one child, “please free the Jews, for I am caked in lice.” His name was Lice Cake, and his only wish was that he could go back to being caked in dirt.

To make his point, Lice Cake broke out into song:

[[Sing the following to the tune of Teenage Dirtbag, the hit single from Wheatus from the year 2000 AD]]

I’m just a teenage lice-bag, baby

Listen to {{ a band or musician stage name that involves “lice” // Lice-T //  // Vanilla Lice }}, baby, with me.

“My people are thanking me for their high quality of lice!” Pharoah mused. “The Jews Stay!”

### ### # {{ Page }}

### Plague Combo Two: Wild Animals (arov), Cattle Disease (dever), and Boils (scheen)

### And God said, “Let there be {{ adjective // angry // I am _. // rampaging }} {{ large mammals // woolly mammoths //  // tapirs }}, {{ adjective // gleeful // I am _. // furious }} {{ large reptiles // Tyrannosauruses // // Komodo dragons }}, and {{ adjective // swingin’ // // free-wheeling }} {{ scary animals // tigers // // fur seals }}, and let them convince Pharaoh to free the Jews.”

The beasts were very persuasive. They {{ took a destructive action // threw a brick through a window //  // damaged the school }}, they {{ took an offensive action // slept through the Pledge of Allegiance // They _, and it was offensive // put their feet on the desk }}, they went into {{ local businesses // pharmacies // // WaWas }} and used the restrooms without purchasing anything.

### Of grave concern, the beasts approached the cattle of Egypt and {{ did something wild animals shouldn’t be doing to/with cattle // wrestled // The wild beasts _ the cattle.  // snuggled }} them. Unfortunately, this gave all the cattle {{ a terrible infectious disease // lassa fever // They got infected with _.  // tetanus}}.

With their big, feverish eyes and plaintive cries, the diseased cattle were so cute to the children of Egypt. They couldn’t help but {{ do an activity that you do with a pet // play fetch with // I am going to _ my dog. // cuddle }} them. And then the children all erupted in boils, as the cattle disease had jumped species yet again.

The parents of Egypt {{ did something that parents do with their kids // went on an educational hike // the parents _ with their kids // read bedtime stories }} with their kids, contracted the boils, and thus the problem boiled out of control.

“How I long to be caked in lice, instead of erupting in pustules, dear Pharaoh,” choked Lice Cake through his boils, spitting pus out of his mouth as he spoke. “Will you not free the Jews?”

“ {{ a consoling phrase // you’ll get through it //  // I’m sorry for your loss }} “ crooned Pharoah as he left the palace, looking for more Jews to enslave.

# {{ Page }}

### Plague Combo Three: Hail (barad), Locusts (arbeh), and Darkness (choshech)

“I hate to burst your boils,”

Safe within his palace, Pharaoh idly asked, “

All hail, Pharaoh

All hail me, indeed.

### # {{ Page }}

### Hail | barad

Pharaoh was brave, and was prepared to let the people of Egypt suffer even more.

And so God rained giant {{ large object // elephant // // rocket }}-sized hail balls down from the sky. This somehow only affected the Egyptians, due to God’s excellent aim and because the Jews had giant {{ large object // elephant // // rocket}}-sized, {{ large object // elephant // // rocket}}-shaped umbrellas.

### # {{ Page }}

### Locusts | arbeh

“I can deal with blood, lice, hail, cattle disease, {{ pandemic // coronavirus //  // coronavirus }}, lice, boils and wild animals” said Pharoah, “It still doesn’t compete with having Jews as slaves. Jewish slaves are like negative fifteen plagues.”

“Seriously?” said Moses. “Well, then how about locusts?”

“They’re fine, too,” said Pharaoh.

“Dam,” said Moses.

“That was blood!” said Pharoah.

“Good hebrew!” said God, adding under His breath, “for a Pharaoh...”

### Darkness | choshech

It’s too dark. I can’t read this plague.

### # {{ Page }}

### Slaying of the First Born | makat Bechorot

And so God decided to do something pretty drastic and off-brand.

“Don’t worry, Moses, they wanna {{ verb //  // They will ___ with us. // dance }} with the G-O-D? They’re gonna get served. I’ve written this rap to emphasize the next step.”

    So you think this GOD doesn’t have what it takes

    To convince you to let go of your chicka-chicka slaves.

    Well take notes, Pharoah, you’re about to learn,

    When I go and kill all of your {{ Person, place, or thing that rhymes with “first born” //  // // worst porn}}.

Pharaoh said, “Did you mean, ‘first born’?”

“Yes,” said God.

Pharaoh shrugged and said, “Bring it, I was cloned.”

So the Jews huddled in their homes, only allowed to talk via Zoom, watch Netflix, and {{ do something you do when you're quarantined // bake bread // During this quarantine, I am going to ___. // get into figure drawing }}. God killed everyone who stood less than 6 feet apart from anyone else. Pharaoh's eldest son, who had been misled by Fox news into taking {{ a bogus remedy // snake oil //  // hydroxychloroquine }} and using tactical butt wipes, died long before any of this even happened.

“Stop this nonsense! The {{ members of an ethnic group, other than Jews // Italians //  // Irish}} can go free!” said Pharaoh.

Moses: “You mean the Jews?”

Pharaoh: “Ohhh, you were asking about ‘the Jews?’ This whole time? Sure, they can go free. I forgot I even had them. I thought you were asking me to free my personal {{ lowly service provider // ditch digger //  // nail trimmer }}, Thachooze. Thachooze, get back to work! I hereby double your burdens.”

# {{ Page }}

### Freedom!!!

So the Jews were freed. They told God they were going into the wilderness to worship Him, then headed to the {{ body of water // Atlantic ocean // we’re going to __  //  Bahamas }} to party and hook up.

Later on, Pharoah got to thinking, “If i don’t have slaves, i’m gonna have to mummify...MYSELF. I don’t even have a son anymore to do it for me.”

So Pharoah changes his mind, jumps into his {{ vehicle // car //  // rocket }} and chases after the Jews. Moses, who kinda saw this coming, gets out his big {{ phallic object // carrot //  // eggplant }} waves it in the air, and the sea totally splits in two. They cross the ocean and when the Egyptians get to the center of the ocean, God says, “{{ a mean exclamation // Screw you! //  // Shame! }}” and murders them.

The Jews celebrate, God gets mad, and makes them wander for 40 years, but then everything’s fine.

{{ An adventure that the Jews went on after they were freed from Egypt, but didn’t make it into the Torah }}

And they lived happily ever after.

# {{ Page }}

# Dayeinu

In freeing the Jews, God did so much more than the bare minimum required.

If God had merely {{verbed (past tense) a noun // funneled a beer // he once ___ // sat on a toilet}}, that would have been ok.

Now if God had {{verbed (past tense) a noun // baked a cake // he once ___ // picked his nose}}, that would have been fine.

If God had {{verbed (past tense) a noun // bit his tongue // he once ___ // farmed some vegetables}}, that would’ve worked well, too.

This is summed up best in a 5-minute song.

[[STAGE DIRECTION: All sing Dayeinu.]]

אִלּוּ הוֹצִיאָֽנוּ מִמִּצְרַֽיִם, דַּיֵּנוּ:

    Ilu hotzianu mi-mitzrayim, Dayeinu

    If God had only taken us out of Egypt, that would have been enough!

אִלּוּ נָתַן לָֽנוּ אֶת־הַתּוֹרָה, דַּיֵּנוּ:

    Ilu natan lanu et ha-Torah, Dayeinu

    If God had only given us the Torah, that would have been enough.

אִלּוּ הוֹצִיאָֽנוּ מִמִּצְרַֽיִם, דַּיֵּנוּ:

    Ilu hotzianu mi-mitzrayim, Dayeinu

    If God had only taken us out of Egypt, that would have been enough!

אִלּוּ נָתַן לָֽנוּ אֶת־הַתּוֹרָה, דַּיֵּנוּ:

    Ilu natan lanu et ha-Torah, Dayeinu

    If God had only given us the Torah, that would have been enough.

# The Passover symbols

[[STAGE DIRECTION: Hold up a proverbial shank bone, or pretend to]]

This, my Jews, is a {{handheld item // coffee cup // I am holding a ___// digital watch}}. It represents a dead lamb. I bring it everywhere with me.

[[STAGE DIRECTION: Hold up some proverbial matzah, or pretend to]]

This is a {{flat thing// plate // The earth is as flat as a___// rug }}. It’s probably the most famous passover symbol. Even my goy friend, {{a flamboyant name // Tessa the best dressa // // Rupaul}} knows what this is! It represents settling for the next best thing.

[[STAGE DIRECTION: Hold up some proverbial maror (horseradish), or pretend to]]

Lastly, but not the last thing before we eat, this {{a barely edible item// this __ // // tuna fish}}, is a bitter herb. It symbolizes the bitterness of slavery and of having to wait 25 hours to eat dinner.

# # {{ Page }}

# Wine Shots, Part Deux

This is our {{very old birthday number // // On my __ birthday // 140th }} glass of wine. Sing.

בָּרוּךְ אַתָּה יְיָ, אֱלֹהֵינוּ מֶלֶךְ הָעוֹלָם, בּוֹרֵא פְּרִי הַגָּפֶן:

    Baruch Atah Adonai, Eloheinu Melech ha-olam, borei p’ree hagafen.

    We praise God, Ruler of Everything, who creates the fruit of the vine.

# Wash your hands and get back to work | rachtza

They say you shouldn’t {{ do an unclean act // make a mud castle // I am going to ___. // squirt squid ink }} where you {{ do an action that requires cleanliness // eat // It had better be clean when I ___. // perform surgery }}. Well, I just did. I did it so hard, YOUR hands are dirty. So let’s wash our hands. I have to wash my {{ body part // foot // This is my ___. // sternum }}, too, because that’s what I did it with.

We wash our hands twice because the number two symbolizes {{ something that the number two symbolizes // masculine and feminine //  // fake cheese and fake meat }}, and because some of us {{ did something that can make your hands dirty // went a-digging in the garden // My hands are dirty because I _. // spilled pretend wine on them }} since the urchatz.

As we pretend to wash our hands, say this with me. Do NOT sing this.

    בָּרוּךְ אַתָּה יְיָ אֱלֹהֵֽינוּ מֶֽלֶךְ הָעוֹלָם, אֲשֶׁר קִדְּשָֽׁנוּ בְּמִצְוֹתָיו, וְצִוָּנוּ

    Baruch Atah Adonai, Eloheinu Melech ha-olam, asher kid’shanu b’mitzvotav v’tzivanu

al n’tilat yadayim.

# Well, bless my little bread | motzi matzah

At this point in the seder, it is customary for {{ Name of person in the video conference // // __ is with us tonight// Josh }} to {{ engage in an activity // square dance  // he always loves to _____ // yodel }}

So, to keep with tradition, please do this so that we may move forward.

[[STAGE DIRECTION: Dramatically Pause]]

Ok now, everyone hold up some matzoh while we all sing to bless this breadless bread.

     בָּרוּךְ אַתָּה יְיָ, אֱלֹהֵֽינוּ מֶֽלֶךְ הָעוֹלָם, הַמּוֹצִיא לֶֽחֶם מִן הָאָֽרֶץ:

    Baruch Atah Adonai, Eloheinu Melech ha-olam, hamotzi lechem min ha-aretz.

    We praise God, Ruler of Everything, who brings bread from the land.

בָּרוּךְ אַתָּה יְיָ, אֱלֹהֵֽינוּ מֶֽלֶךְ הָעוֹלָם, אֲשֶׁר קִדְּשָֽׁנוּ בְּמִצְוֹתַָיו וְצִוָּֽנוּ עַל אֲכִילַת מַצָּה:

    Baruch Atah Adonai, Eloheinu Melech ha-olam, asher kid’shanu b’mitzvotav v’tzivanu

al achilat matzah.

    We praise God, Ruler of Everything, who made us holy through obligations, commanding us to eat matzah.

# # {{ Page }}

# Justa little bittah more | maror

We now sing as we spread delicious charoset and religiously-significant (kinda gross) maror on so-gross-it-has-to-be-religiously-significant matzoh. This represents the bittersweetness of doing rituals when you’re hungry. Just dip--do not eat.

    בָּרוּךְ אַתָּה יְיַָ אֱלֹהֵֽינוּ מֶֽלֶךְ הָעוֹלָם, אֲשֶׁר קִדְּשָֽׁנוּ בְּמִצְוֹתָיו וְצִוָּֽנוּ עַל אֲכִילַת מָרוֹר:

    Baruch Atah Adonai, Eloheinu Melech ha-olam, asher kid’shanu b’mitzvotav v’tzivanu

al achilat maror.

    We praise God, Ruler of Everything, who made us holy through obligations, commanding us to eat bitter herbs.

## # {{ Page }}

## Eat, but not the meal | koreich

We now eat this {{ collection of foods that doesn’t go together well // cream cheese popsicle // after trying a ____ he decided he wouldn’t eat that ever again // cream cheese tuna popsicle }} as our ancestors did before us. It symbolizes misery, we think.

## # {{ Page }}

## Revise the Haggadah endlessly

As is tradition, we will now workshop the entire Haggadah up to this point, and refine it into a product we can charge money for, in observation of the unpleasant tasks performed by our ancestors, the Jews.

JUST KIDDING.

# OMG can we pretend to eat now!? | shulchan oreich

JEEZ, we get it, you’re hungry, EAT. When you are ready to conclude the seder (after the meal) go to the next page

## # {{ Page }}

## The THIRD glass of wine (starting to feel it yet?)

Please have your third glass of wine (we hope you didn’t have any more wine during dinner), and sing another song.

    בָּרוּךְ אַתָּה יְיָ, אֱלֹהֵינוּ מֶלֶךְ הָעוֹלָם, בּוֹרֵא פְּרִי הַגָּפֶן:

Elijah can not only open doors, but he can get into a zoom meeting without the password. He’s here right now. Pour him a drink and tell him how your really feel. Repeat after me.

Thank you Elijah for being such a(n) {{ adjective // funny // // awful }} spirit.

Everyone!

Thank you Elijah for being such a(n) (adjective from above) spirit.

Now let's sing!

# Closing rites

## The FOURTH glass of wine

As we drink this last cup of wine, we contemplate what we want for this year. I, for one, want {{ a thing I want // money // he wants ____ // tacos }}. As we sing, we praise God, we appreciate one another, and we cherish the time we have together and the memories we create. And this lengthy Haggadah we write every year.

    בָּרוּךְ אַתָּה יְיָ, אֱלֹהֵינוּ מֶלֶךְ הָעוֹלָם, בּוֹרֵא פְּרִי הַגָּפֶן:

Pharaoh swimming in a pool of frogs

In beginning, maybe introduce all the items on the seder plate.

In kadeish: {{ something virtuous women can make you do }}

Read through the example scripts, and lib out meanings (four cups means X) and examples.

{{ a very Jewish-sounding name }}

We are gathered virtually because we do not exist just in the flesh

One of us hopes that {{ something you hope for the future }}

{{ something you do to elevate your love for God }}

{{ something that would be an actual sacrifice }}, to remind us of how the ancients used to sacrifice lambs.

The son who knows not how to ask: This is more of a comment, really. I command...I order, I insist, I proclaim that. Also, {{ nonsense gibberish }}.

{{ how God introduces Herself }}

{{ a name for God }}

{{ something you do when you’re in a rush }} represented the haste of our departure

{{ Let’s pick up the pace here }}

This past year hasn’t been all bad. For one of us, this past year meant {{ something good that happened in the past year }}.

{{ Something you need to do become a Pharoah }}

In karpas: Acknowledge the little losses of the past year
